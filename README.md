This analysis served several different purposes intended top help the school districts determine the students grade. In deliverable one, we had to set the reading and math grades of ninth grade to NAN. This is because the ninth graders testing scores were not counted. Next we analysed the data to produce summary statistics for reading and math scores for 10th, 11th, and 12th grade levels. 
Next, We analsyed the grade data by indicidual school. This was important to see how this school compared to the total average of all schools. Thomas Highschool's math, reading, and overall scores. This will have value to the administration at Thomas Highschool to see how they competed against other schools. 
In deliverable two we ranked thhe top five schools by math, reading, and overall passing. This shows which schools were the top preformers on standardized exams. 
Next, we analysed school by spending. This data will be important in determing the relationship between school and funding per school.

                                                                              Results
   - The District Summary is affected by lowering the overall score. 9th Grades had typically above average test scores. The edit of the scores to NaN, lowered the mean test scores.
   - The school summary is effected because those that had higher 9th grade scores than the mean will not score as well.
   - replacing the 9th grade does not lower school size because it does not replace count, but only test scores. 
   -Because 9th graders are not in the count any more spending will be allocated to higher grades
